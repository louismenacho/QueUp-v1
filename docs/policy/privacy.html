                                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                            </header>
							
							<h3>General</h3>
							<p>QueUp is developed and maintained by one developer. As the developer of QueUp, I do care about and respect your privacy.
							This Privacy Policy aims to describe how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.
							By using QueUp, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
							
							<h3>Information being collected</h3>
							<p>QueUp does not collect any personally identifiable information.</p>
							<p>QueUp uses three third party services which collect information:</p>
							
                            <h4>a.) Spotify</h4>
                            <p>Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. QueUp does request limited access to a user's Spotify account. QueUp requests permission to obtain read access to a user’s subscription details, write access to a user’s playback state, and remote control playback of the Spotify app. These permissions are used by QueUp solely to determine whether a user has a premium account type to be able add songs to the player queue and start playback in Spotify using Spotify's Web API. These permissions also grants access to some personally identifiable information (your email address, your display name). This personally identifiable information is never accessed, used, stored or disclosed by QueUp.</p>
                            <p>Spotify does collect personal data. However, QueUp does not provide any personally identifiable information to Spotify.</p>
							<p>For more information, see the Spotify Privacy Policy</p>
							
                            <h4>b.) Firebase Cloud Firestore</h4>
							<p>Firebase Cloud Firestore is a database by Google. QueUp uses this service to store, and keep data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners. For example, creating group sessions (rooms), and synchronizing collaborative lists of songs in each room, etc.</p>
							<p>It is not clear to me whether Firebase Cloud Firestore collects personally identifiable information. However, QueUp does not provide any personally identifiable information to Firebase Cloud Firestore.</p>
							<p>For more information, see the Firebase Privacy Policy</p>
                            
                            <h4>c.) Firebase Authentication</h4>
                            <p>Firebase Authentication is a backend service by Google to authenticate users to your app. QueUp uses this service to create and use temporary anonymous accounts to authenticate with Firebase. These temporary anonymous accounts can be used to allow users to work with data protected by security rules</p>
                            <p>It is not clear to me whether Firebase Authentication collects personally identifiable information. However, QueUp does not provide any personally identifiable information to Firebase Authentication.</p>
                            <p>For more information, see the Firebase Privacy Policy</p>
